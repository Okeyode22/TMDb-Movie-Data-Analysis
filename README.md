## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the
the profit generated and revenue. It is evident that as the profit increases revenue
increaases as well. This is a somewhat perfect corelations between the two variables.
Profit is gotten by substracting the budget of the movie from revenue gained.

I also observed that the Animation genres is the most popular genresâ€™ followed closely
by Adventure and Fantasy. Animation genres has the highest popularity index.
